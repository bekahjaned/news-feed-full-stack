# News Feed

A full-stack application that displays a simple dashboard with a news feed. The articles are retrieved from the New York Times API. Users may add and remove articles to and from a Favourites side panel.

### Stack

The front-end client of this application was built with React js. Styled-components was used for styling.

The back-end server was built using Node.js with Express.

The node-cron module was used to periodically refresh the API every minute at the 5th second.

### Running this App

This is a full-stack app, so bith the front-end and server must both be running in order for the application to work.

## Marketing
