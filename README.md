# News Feed

A full-stack application that displays a simple dashboard with a news feed. The articles are retrieved from the New York Times API. Users may add and remove articles to and from a Favourites side panel.

### Stack

The front-end client of this application was built with React js. Styled-components was used for styling.

The back-end server was built using Node.js with Express.

The node-cron module was used to periodically refresh the API every minute at the 5th second.

## Accessibility

Colours were compared using this [chart](https://toolness.github.io/accessible-color-matrix/?n=white&n=light&n=bright&n=medium&n=dark&n=black&v=FFFFFF&v=D4F9F3&v=016099&v=FFD6D4&v=9143DF&v=000000) to ensure proper contrast.

Both icon buttons have different states for inactive, hover, and active.

All img tags have alternate text.

### Running this App

This is a full-stack app, so both the front-end and server must both be running in order for the application to work.

## Marketing
